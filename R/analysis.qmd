## Introduction

This document offers a straightforward analysis of the well-known penguin dataset. It is designed to complement the [Productive R Workflow](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com) online course.

You can read more about the penguin dataset [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

Let's load libraries before we start!

```{r library}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(DT)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(patchwork)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading data

The dataset has already been loaded and cleaned in the previous step of this pipeline.

Let's load the clean version, together with a few functions available in `functions.R`.

```{r}
# Source function
source(here::here("R", "functions.R"))

# Read the clean dataset
data <- readRDS(here::here("input", "clean_data.rds"))
```

You can inspect the data directly below.

```{r}
# Make a table
datatable(data, filter = "top")
```

## Bill Length and Bill Depth

In this report exercise, we will explore the Penguin data. We will delve deeper into the penguin's bill. Specifically, we investigate its length, depth, and their relationship.

How does one measure a penguin bill's length and depth? The following picture gives us a clue.

Now, let's make some descriptive analysis, including <b>summary statistics</b> and <b>graphs</b>.

::: {.callout-note}
What's striking is the <b>slightly negative relationship</b> between `bill length` and `bill depth`:
:::

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| fig.align: "center"
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.cap: "Relationship between bill <b>length</b> and bill <b>depth</b>. <b>All</b> data points included."

data %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)
  ) +
    geom_point(color="#69b3a2") +
    labs(
      x = "Bill Length (mm)",
      y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
      title = paste("Surprising relationship?")
    ) + 
  theme_ipsum()
```

It is also interesting to note that `bill length` and `bill depth` are quite different from one species to another. The average of a variable can be computed as follow:

$Avg=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} = \frac{a_{1} + a_{2} + ... + a_{n}}{n}$

The following tables summarize the average `bill length` and `bill depth` by species.

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2

bill_length_per_species <- data %>%
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(average_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

bill_depth_per_species <- data %>%
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(average_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

knitr::kable(bill_length_per_species)
knitr::kable(bill_depth_per_species)

```
